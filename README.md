# SwiftBot
First Year Computer Science Group Project Task

This was my first ever where I worked in a group setting following an agile methodology to develop a solution to a task.
The task I chose to do was called "Detect Object".

Detect Object Task required to write a program that had a UI and took user input to chosse from a few different modes which were variations of
the robot moving in a certain pattern and detecting an object to then perform a sequence of actions accordingly.

The robot we used was raspberry Pi powered robot with two motors for the wheels, LED lights, a camera and an ultrasound sensor. 
I used APIs to use these components and I used OOP practices as well as control flow, loops and other programming practices. 
I ran many tests and learnt how to debug the code.
